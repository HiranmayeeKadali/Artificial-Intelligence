 This repo contains assignments worked in Artificial Intelligence programming at BTH


# Assignment 1: Lab 1: Search
# Problem Description:
Solve the Eight Queens Puzzle using two search methods: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The Eight Queens Puzzle involves placing eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that none of them can capture each other using standard chess queen moves.
#Tasks:
+ Implementation: Implement DFS and BFS solutions separately.
+ Performance Comparison: Compare the performance of DFS and BFS solutions. Determine which method is better and why.
+ Time Complexity Analysis: Analyze the time complexity of both search techniques.
+ Backtracking Analysis: Evaluate whether backtracking provides better solutions and analyze its time complexity.

# Assignment 2: Genetic Algorithms
# Goal:
+ Explore and implement Genetic Algorithms (GA) to solve optimization problems. Analyze the effects of population sizes and mutation probabilities on GA performance.

# Tasks:
# Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):
+ Implement a GA to solve the TSP.
+ Test different combinations of population sizes and mutation probabilities.
+ Analyze and discuss the results.

# Maximization Problem:
+ Implement a fitness function for a given mathematical equation.
+ Use GA to optimize the equation.

# Assignment 3: Regression Models vs. Neural Networks
# Description: 
+ Compare regression models with neural network models using generated data points that follow the square function with added noise.

# Steps:
+ Data Generation: Generate data points with noise.
+ Linear Regression: Establish a linear regression model.
+ Polynomial Regression: Establish a polynomial model.
+ Neural Network: Establish a three-layer neural network.
+ Model Evaluation: Compare mean squared errors of all models.
+ Visualization: Plot data points and prediction curves for regression models.

# Implementation:
+ All implementations must be done in Python.
+ Utilize libraries such as sklearn, keras, and/or tensorflow.
+ Include detailed reports analyzing the results and submit the code.

# Conclusion:
These assignments provide a comprehensive understanding of search algorithms, genetic algorithms, and regression models, enhancing skills in problem-solving and algorithmic analysis.
